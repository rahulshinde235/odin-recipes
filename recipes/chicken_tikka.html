    <h2>How to Make Chicken Tikka Masala</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken tikka masala is usually made with heavy cream, but I like to use
      coconut milk instead; its subtle sweetness works beautifully with the
      spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.

      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Chicken Tikka Masala Step-By-Step</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the chicken: Combine yogurt, garam masala, paprika, black pepper,
        salt, cayenne pepper, and coriander in a large bowl. Add chicken strips
        and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a rimmed
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from marinade and place onto the prepared baking sheet,
        leaving space between each piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink inside,
        about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
        should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin
        seeds and cook, sirring gently, until lightly toasted and aromatic,
        about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to soften,
        4 to 5 minutes. Add chile peppers, garlic, and ginger; continue to cook
        and stir until onion is browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in tomatoes,
        tomato paste, and water; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes
        begin to break down, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garam masala, coriander, turmeric, and salt, then stir in chicken
        and cream until well combined; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Garnish
        with cilantro.
      </li>
    </ol>
